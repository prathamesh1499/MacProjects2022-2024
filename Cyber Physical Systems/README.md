## <b>Dataset:</b> 
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dheerajperumandla/drowsiness-dataset

     How to use the dataset 2 ways:
1st Way: 
- Download the dataset and manually upload on the google drive and then use it in the code.

2nd Way:
- use the following website to refer the steps to automatically connect kaggle id with your colab.

## <b> CODE: </b> 
- <u><b>Inital.ipynb</b></u> - 
    -    contains the a CNN model proposed by us for multi-class classification. 
- <u><b>Transfer_learning.ipynb</b></u>  
    -   contains the InceptionV3 architecture for the classification task.

<H2> STEPS to execute. </H2>
- You can choose to execute cell by cell to understand how a particular part of code works.
 OR 
- You may choose to run all cells and scroll at the bottom to see the results. 

<H2>References</H2>

    We made some modifications for both our proposed model and the transfer learning model. The following Reference was used to create a good model, as initially we were using very less layers.
